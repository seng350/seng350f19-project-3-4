Hello :)

Team Name: SEAR Software


Project Ideas:

Travel App Idea
- Limit the scope to Victoria and the various things you can do.
- Parking information
- Events/Ticketing
- Filtering information in some way to make it more specific

Ranking App
- Yelp for profs and courses
- Lecture halls, food places, etc
- Alcohol

UVIC Squeak Seat
- Gives you a map of lecture halls and shows you which seats are super squeaky
- Functionality for people to submit new squeaky seats

Price Comparison App
- Builds up a database by web scraping various sites for product information
- Uses keywords to compare products based on various features, and also on price

Homework Helper App
- Keeps track of homework for the user
- User inputs what grade they want to achieve in that class and the grading scheme for everything. Then the user would input how much they spent working/studying on a specific item, what grade they got, and then the app would calculate how much time they needed to spend on all the following assignments to achieve their target grade

To do list app
- Try and solve the problem of "the user doesn't want to have to input that much data" but then how do we support the needs of what the user wants from a to do app? How often do we send notifications? How do we visualize it for them? How do we add prioritization.
