Course Overview
Security Engineering is about building systems to remain secure in the face of malice, error or mischance. The objective
of this course is to introduce students to a broad range of topics related to this discipline, including an overview of
computer security, protection, disaster planning, and recovery. Risk analysis and security plans. Basics of cryptography.
Public key cryptography and protocols. Security models, kernel design and systems testing. Database, network and Web
security. The course discusses applications which need various combinations of confidentiality, availability, integrity and
covertness properties; mechanisms to incorporate these properties in systems. Policy and legal issues are also covered

Grading System
The University of Victoria follows a percentage grading system in which the instructor will submit grades in percentages.
The University will use the following Senate approved standardized grading scale to assign letter grades. Both the
percentage mark and the letter grade will be recorded on the academic record and transcripts.
FDCC+B-BB+A-AA+
0-4950-5960-6465-6970-7273-7677-7980-8485-8990-100
GradesDescription
A+, A,
A-
Exceptional, outstanding or excellent performance. Normally achieved by a minority of students. These
grades indicate a student who is self-initiating, exceeds expectation and has an insightful grasp of the subject
matter.
B+, B,
B-
Very good, good or solid performance. Normally achieved by the largest number of students. These grades
indicate a good grasp of the subject matter or excellent grasp in one area balanced with satisfactory grasp in
the other areas.
C+, C
Satisfactory, or minimally satisfactory. These grades indicate a satisfactory performance and knowledge of
the subject matter.
DMarginal Performance. A student receiving this grade demonstrated a superficial grasp of the subject matter.
FUnsatisfactory performance. Wrote final examination and completed course requirements; no supplemental.
Posting of Grades
Typically marks for assignments, examinations, and provisional final grades, are made available through conneX, or
CourseSpaces where each student will be able to view only their own grades. Sometimes numerical marks/grades may
be posted publicly to the entire class. In that case, full student numbers or names will not be included with the posted
information.
Course Experience Survey (CES)
I value your feedback on this course. Towards the end of term you will have the opportunity to complete a confidential
course experience survey (CES) regarding your learning experience. The survey is vital to providing feedback to me
regarding the course and my teaching, as well as to help the department improve the overall program for students in
the future. When it is time for you to complete the survey, you will receive an email inviting you to do so. If you do not
receive an email invitation, you can go directly to the CES site

You will need to use your UVic NetLink ID to access the survey, which can be done on your laptop, tablet or mobile
device. I will remind you closer to the time, but please be thinking about this important activity, especially the
following three questions, during the course.
What strengths did your instructor demonstrate that helped you learn in this course?
Please provide specific suggestions as to how the instructor could have helped you learn more effectively.

Csc Student Groups
The Computer Science Course Union (https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/cscu/) serves all students who are
either in a computer science program or taking a class in computer science. Please sign yourself up on their mailing list
if you would like to be informed about their social events and services.
The Engineering Students' Society (ESS) serves all students registered in an Engineering degree program, including
Software Engineering (BSEng). For information on ESS activities, events and services navigate to

Course Policies And Guidelines
Late Assignments: No late assignments will be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor
at least 48 hours before the assignment due date.
Coursework Mark Appeals: All marks must be appealed within 7 days of the mark being posted.
Attendance: We expect students attend all lectures and labs. It is entirely the students' responsibility to recover any
information or announcements presented in lectures from which they were absent.
Electronic devices in labs and lectures: No unauthorized audio or video recording of lectures is permitted.
Electronic devices in midterms and exams: Calculators are only permitted for examinations and tests if explicitly
authorized and the type of calculator permitted may be restricted. No other electronic devices (e.g. cell phones,
pagers, PDA, etc.) may be used during examinations or tests unless explicitly authorized.
Plagiarism: Submitted work may be checked using plagiarism detection software. Cheating, plagiarism and other forms
of academic fraud are taken very seriously by both the University and the Department. You should consult the link given
below for the UVic policy on academic integrity. Note that the university policy includes the statement that "A largely or
fully plagiarized assignment should result in a grade of F for the course."
The Faculty of Engineering Standards for Professional Behaviour are at
http://www.uvic.ca/shared/shared%5fengineering/docs/professional-behaviour.pdf
U.Vic guidelines and policy concerning fraud and academic integrity are at
http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/info/regulations/academic-integrity.html
U. Vic Privacy Policy: If any student has concerns about their private information being stored or accessed outside of
Canada, they are required to inform the course instructor about their concerns before the end of second week of
classes.
Equality
This course aims to provide equal opportunities and access for all students to enjoy the benefits and privileges of the
class and its curriculum and to meet the syllabus requirements. Reasonable and appropriate accommodation will be
made available to students with documented disabilities (physical, mental, learning) in order to give them the
opportunity to successfully meet the essential requirements of the course. The accommodation will not alter academic
standards or learning outcomes, although the student may be allowed to demonstrate knowledge and skills in a different
way. It is not necessary for you to reveal your disability and/or confidential medical information to the course instructor.
If you believe that you may require accommodation, the course instructor can provide you with information about
confidential resources on campus that can assist you in arranging for appropriate accommodation. Alternatively, you
may want to contact the Centre for Accessible Learning (formerly the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability)
located in the Campus Services Building.
The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, and supportive and safe
learning and working environment for all its members.
